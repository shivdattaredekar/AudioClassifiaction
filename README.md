# Audio Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on audio classification using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify audio samples into predefined categories based on their features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Audio samples are preprocessed to extract relevant features.
- **Model Training:** ANN models are trained on the preprocessed data.
- **Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** A trained model is deployed for real-time classification of audio samples.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-classification.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the audio data using the provided scripts.
2. Train the model by running `train.py`.
3. Evaluate the trained model using `evaluate.py`.
4. Deploy the model using the provided deployment scripts.

## Dataset

The project uses the UrbanSound8K dataset, which contains audio samples from various urban environments. The dataset consists of the following classes, each with a specified number of samples:

- **Dog Bark:** 1000 samples
- **Children Playing:** 1000 samples
- **Air Conditioner:** 1000 samples
- **Street Music:** 1000 samples
- **Engine Idling:** 1000 samples
- **Jackhammer:** 1000 samples
- **Drilling:** 1000 samples
- **Siren:** 929 samples
- **Car Horn:** 429 samples
- **Gun Shot:** 374 samples

You can download the UrbanSound8K dataset from [this link](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).

## Results

The performance of the model is as follows:

- **Accuracy:** [accuracy]
- **Precision:** [precision]
- **Recall:** [recall]
- **F1 Score:** [F1 score]
